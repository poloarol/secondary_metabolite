# Mining Biosynthetic Gene Cluster: (ML-Miner)

## What are Biosynthetic Gene Clusters:

  Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are clusters of genes or operons, which work together to encode a specialized metabolite aka Natural Products.
  Natural Products are small bioactive molecules produced by living organisms as products of secondary metabolism, hence are not neccesary for survival,
  but confer an evolutionary advantage.
