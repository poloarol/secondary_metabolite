## What are Biosynthetic Gene Clusters:

  Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are clusters of genes or operons, which work together to encode a specialized metabolite aka Natural Products.
  Natural Products are small bioactive molecules which produced by living organisms as products of secondary metabolism.
